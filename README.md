Authors: *Lami Beach, Michael Refvem, Andrew Smith*

This is a Unity game with a 2D, top-down, RPG environment. The object of this game is to navigate your player through an unforgiving landscape that is smothered with rutheless enemies. Once all enemies are slayne, a 'final boss' will appear that is even more lethal than all other enemies and must be defeated. Only then can the game be completed.
