# Zenith Warrior - Requirements

## Vision
The vision of this game started when three awesome gentlemen were put into a group and decided to take on something fun.
All of us enjoy video games and we thought contributing to something we love would be something new and exciting.

This game is meant to be a take on 2D top down RPG's. The game industry is filled with 3D animtaion but our group
has the nostalgia for original 2D gaming and thought we'd make something new but original.

You should care about this game if you love 2D top down RPG's or 2D gaming in genral. The nostalgia alone
will leave you beckoning for another level.


## Scope

Zenith Warrior will allow users to:

Engage enemies in a top down 2D RPG.

Listen to 8-bit audio.

Use a weapon to kill enemies.

Use a controller if it is an Xbox controller with blutooth input/output.



Zenith Warrior will not allow users to:

Engage in multiplayer.

Be an IOS or Android App.



## Minimum Viable Product

The MVP will allow a user to:

Start the game on one level.

Kill enemies and traverse the level.

Kill the final boss.

Win the game / Die until you win the game.


## Stretch Goals

We're hoping to implement:

A.I. Enemies - so they can move toward you and attack you.

More levels - so the user can travel further.

Difficulty settings - so the player can choose harder/easier modes.


## Functional Requirements

A user can view how to play the game.

A user can start the game.

A user can move around the map.

A user can attack enemies.

A user can be killed by enemy.



## Data Flow

When the user starts up Zenith Warrior they will be greeted with the menu. The user can start the game or 
the user can view the tutorial on how to play the game. Once the game has started the user will need to find and kill enemies in order to get to 
the boss. Once at the boss the user will have to kill the boss. The user can die so the objective is not to die. If they win a screen will prompt them
notifying them they won and vice versa for if they lose.



## Non-Functional Requirements

Reusability:  reusability is the use of existing assets in some form within the software product development process;
these assets are products and by-products of the software development life cycle and include code, software components, 
test suites, designs and documentation.

		Zenith Warrior capitalizes on Reusability by implementing assets readily available to not only optimize time but deliver 
		overall quality from areas of weakness. Unity suite utilizes its own sort of Intellisense to recognize when optimization
		is either needed or not functioning correctly as well. The intermix of Unity and VS Code 2019 allow the sub routines from 
		scripts to be run which is fantastic and easy to use.






Development Environment: The development environment (dev) is the environment in which changes to software are developed, 
most simply an individual developer's workstation. This differs from the ultimate target environment in various ways â€“ the target may not be a desktop computer 
(it may be a smartphone, embedded system, headless machine in a data center, etc.), and even if otherwise similar, 
the developer's environment will include development tools like a compiler, integrated development environment, 
different or additional versions of libraries and support software, etc., which are not present in a user's environment.


		Zenith Warrior is built using Unity which his a fantastic development environment. Unity implements tutorials inside
		the suite itself and can guide you when first learning. The best part is it allows you to test your game or product
		right inside of the suite itself. You can assess if your changes to what you're doing are implemented correctly.
		The requirements for a computer to run this program are dependant on the outcome of what you're trying to develop. I.e. 2D vs. 3D.
